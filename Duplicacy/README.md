# Duplicacy

Duplicacy is... weird. I don't like it, but it works, and everything else that's out there I dislike or can't use for some reason or another.

## Setting it up



## Using the CLI

To use the CLI to perform actions on repositories (eg pruning), cd to `~/.duplicacy-web/repositories/localhost/all`, and run the CLI from there. You can't modify settings from there though; those are stored in `~/.duplicacy-web/duplicacy.json` and read on startup only.
