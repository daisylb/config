# Local machine configuration

## What this repo configures, and how

### Homebrew itself, Git, Pyenv, and Poetry

**Not implemented yet**

These are configured by the bootstrap script, because they are needed for configsync to run.

## Configuration files directories for tools

A handful of tools have configuration files or directories in this repo. Symlinks are created from their expected locations pointing here, controlled by the `[symlinks]` table of `config.toml`. Those tools are as follows:

- `vscode-config`: Visual Studio Code
- `fish-config`: Fish shell

## Homebrew packages, Homebrew Casks and Mac App Store packages

**Not implemented yet**

These are stored in the `Brewfile`. This file is updated by runningÂ `brew bundle dump` to a temporary file, then merging that file into the existing file. It is applied by running `brew bundle install` to install the listed packages, then `brew bundle cleanup` to remove non-listed ones.

## Python packages
- Python packages are stored in `python-packages.toml`, and installed with `pipx`. `pipx` itself is installed with `pip install --user`.
- Node packages are not installed ahead of time; I run them as needed with `npx`, which is now part of Node.
- Visual Studio Code extensions are stored in `vscode-extensions.toml`.
- Configuration directories for various tools are symlinked into this directory.
